# üßæ Order Management Service API

### Overview  
This project is a **RESTful API** for managing e-commerce orders, built with **Spring Boot** and **Java 17**.  
It was developed as part of the **Digital NAO ‚ÄúSpring and Spring Boot in Java for Web Applications‚Äù** challenge.

The API provides a complete set of endpoints to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on orders, using an in-memory **H2 database** for development purposes.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting orders.  
- **In-Memory Database:** Uses H2 database, automatically configured and launched with the application.  
- **RESTful Architecture:** Follows clean design practices for scalable web APIs.  
- **Organized Structure:** Follows a layered pattern ‚Äî *Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Model* ‚Äî for better maintainability.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuisDavid0912/Spring-boot-order-service.git
cd order-management
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Run the Application

This project uses the Maven Wrapper (mvnw), so you don‚Äôt need a global Maven installation.

üñ•Ô∏è On macOS/Linux:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

üíª On Windows:

```bash
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

When it starts successfully, the server runs at:
üëâ http://localhost:8080

## üì° Using the API

You can test all endpoints using the provided Postman collection file:
Order Service API.postman_collection.json

üîó Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/orders	Create a new order
GET	/api/orders	Retrieve all orders
GET	/api/orders/{id}	Get an order by ID
PUT	/api/orders/{id}	Update an existing order
DELETE	/api/orders/{id}	Delete an order


## üóÉÔ∏è H2 Database Console

## üß† Sprint 1 Team Decisions


### üß© Technology Stack

Used Spring Boot 3 with Java 17 as required by the challenge ‚Äî modern, efficient, and well-supported for enterprise-grade web apps.

### üóÑÔ∏è Database

Selected H2 as the in-memory database for Sprint 1 to simplify setup and accelerate development.
In Sprint 2, the goal is to integrate PostgreSQL via environment profiles for a production-ready setup.

### üß± Architecture

Implemented a layered architecture (Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository) for clarity, scalability, and maintainability.
This separation of concerns makes it easier to add new features or switch databases later.

üß† Sprint 2 Team Decisions

üõ°Ô∏è Implementing Environment Profiles for Security and Flexibility
The primary goal of Sprint 2 was to mature the application's configuration, moving from a single setup to a professional, multi-environment structure. This directly addresses the core problem presented in the challenge narrative, where a misconfiguration in a production environment caused critical failures.

Key Decisions:

Adoption of YAML Configuration (.yml):

Decision: Migrated from a single .properties file to multiple .yml files.

Justification: YAML's hierarchical structure is far superior for managing complex configurations and defining multiple profiles within a single, readable format. It makes the distinction between environments clean and intuitive.

Creation of dev and prod Profiles:

Decision: Created two distinct profiles: application-dev.yml for local development and application-prod.yml for a production-ready setup.

Justification: This separation is crucial. The dev profile is optimized for speed and ease of use (H2 in-memory database, H2 console enabled), while the prod profile is configured for robustness and security (PostgreSQL connection, secrets managed separately). This prevents development tools from ever being active in a production environment.

Securing Credentials with Environment Variables:

Decision: The production database password is not hardcoded. Instead, it is loaded from an environment variable (${DB_PASSWORD}).

Justification: This is the most critical security decision of this sprint. Hardcoding secrets in source code is a major security vulnerability. By using environment variables, the application's code remains secure and can be safely stored in any repository. The actual secrets are managed on the server, completely separate from the codebase, following industry best practices.

<summary><strong>Sprint 2: Running with Environment Profiles</strong></summary>

This application is configured with Environment Profiles to separate development (dev) settings from production (prod) settings.

dev profile (default): Uses an in-memory H2 database and enables the H2 console. Perfect for local development.

prod profile: Configured for a PostgreSQL database and secures the database password using an environment variable.

Running with the Production Profile
To run the application using the prod profile, you first need to set the required environment variable and then specify the profile during launch.

1. Set the Environment Variable
This variable holds the database password securely, preventing it from being stored in the source code.

On macOS/Linux:

export DB_PASSWORD="your_secure_password_here"

On Windows:

set DB_PASSWORD="your_secure_password_here"

2. Run the Application with the prod Profile
Use the -Dspring-boot.run.profiles flag to specify the active profile:

On macOS/Linux:

./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=prod

On Windows:

.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=prod

The application will now start on port 8081 and attempt to connect to a PostgreSQL database using the credentials you provided.
